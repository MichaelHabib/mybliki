        ◦ Hang around Rich & Successful people.
        ◦ Get "Both" when options are presented
            ▪ You can have it all.
            ▪ 'Practice thinking and creating ways of having 'both,'' says Eker. 'Whenever alternatives are presente e never say 'either/or' -- they say 'both,' because they know you can have it all.
            ▪ 'Nowhere is 'both' thinking more important than when it comes to money,' emphasises Eker. 'Poor and many middle-class people believe that they have to choose between money and the other aspects of life. Consequently they have rationalized a position that money is not as important as other things.'
