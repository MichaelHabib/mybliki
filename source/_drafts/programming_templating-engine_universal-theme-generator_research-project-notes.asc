= Universal Theme Generator
- Purpose of document: a place to collect all my notes & research data related to my attempt at finding and/or creating a universal theme generator.

== Goals
* convert instructions into templates for selected template engines then compile the code into file & folder format that's appropriate  for the target software templateing system implementation.
** Example 1 : [Pug or HAML] to [Twig] then [Grunt or Gulp] to generate the correct files & folder structure for the target template engine & software.



== ToDo
* Find common features in popular template engines & find a way to trans-compile them.
