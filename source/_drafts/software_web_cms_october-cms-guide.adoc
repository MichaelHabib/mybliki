== About October CMS

== Installation & Config Guide

=== Initial Setup
```
composer create-project october/october myoctober
cd ./myoctober
php artisan october:install
```
To access the backend, add `/bhackend` to your root domain (unless you changed the default backend tour during installation).

=== Setting up the scheduler
For scheduled tasks to operate correctly, you should add the following Cron entry to your server. Editing the crontab is commonly performed with the command `crontab -e`.
`* * * * * php /path/to/artisan schedule:run >> /dev/null 2>&1`

=== Configuration

==== Active Theme
The active theme is set with the activeTheme parameter in the config/cms.php file or with the Theme Selector on the System > CMS > Front-end Theme back-end page. The theme set with the Theme Selector overrides the value in the config/cms.php file.


== File Structure
October supports a single level subdirectories for pages, partials, layouts and content files (the assets directory can have any structure).

```
themes/
    website/          <=== Theme starts here
        pages/            <=== Pages directory
            home.htm

== Themes
* Theme development docs: https://octobercms.com/docs/themes/development

=== How to create templates?
pages, partials and layout templates can include up to 3 sections: configuration, PHP code, and Twig markup. Sections are separated with the ``==`` sequence. For example:

```
url = "/blog"
layout = "default"
==
function onStart()
{
    $this['posts'] = ...;
}
==
<h3>Blog archive</h3>
{% for post in posts %}
    <h4>{{ post.title }}</h4>
    {{ post.content }}
{% endfor %}
```
Notes:
* The config section uses .INI format with string values enclosed in quotes.
* The PHP section can have optional opening & closing tags. Also. only functions & name spaces are allowed.
