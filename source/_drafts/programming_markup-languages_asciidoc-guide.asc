=== Tables

==== Basic Table Structure:
- Table starts & ends with `|===`
- The first line is considered table header, leave empty if there are no table headers.
- Each  cell starts with a pipe ` | `.
- Columns can be places on one or multiple consecutive lines with no spaces in between.
- Rows can must have one or more white space between them.

==== `[cols=""]` attribute:
- More columns formating info can be found at https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#cols-format
- Number of values assigned to `[cols="1,2,3"]` indicates the number of columns.
- The values can be alignment instructions or styling information (ToDo: can they be both?). Available styles are : `d` for default paragraph formatting, `a` for AsciiDOc, `e` for Italicized text, `h` for header style, `l` for literal block formatting, `m` for monospaced content, `s` for bold text and `v` for verse styling.
