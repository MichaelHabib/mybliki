Payments & Terms

We accept the following credit cards for payment: Visa, Mastercard, American Express & Discover. For products with a one-time charge, payment is due immediately at time of purchase. For subscription based products (with a monthly fee), payment will be due on the anniversary date of the original purchase date. If the product has a free trial period, the anniversary date will be the date on which your trial ends. For each additional subscription based product purchase, payment will be added to your existing billing cycle. Items purchased during a month will be prorated and added to your next invoice.

Example 1: If you purchase a subscription based product on Jan 1st that has no free trial, your anniversary date would be the 1st and you would be billed the 1st of each month. Each addtional subscription based product you purchase would then be added to your existing billing cycle (the 1st of each month), regardless of the date it is purchased on.

Example 2: If you purchase a subscription based product on Jan 1st that has a 14 day free trial, your anniversary date would be Jan 15th as that would be the first day you would start being charged for your purchase and you would be billed the 15th of each month. Each addtional subscription based product you purchase would then be added to your existing billing cycle (the 15st of each month), regardless of the date it is purchased on.

All payments are made in USD (United States Dollar).
