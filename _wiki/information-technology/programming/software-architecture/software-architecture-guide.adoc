=== Quality Attributes
Quality Attributes are system properties that are separate from the functionality of the system. 

==== Static / Execution Quality Attributes
Reflect the structure of the system and organization, e.g : modularity, testability, maintainability, etc ...

==== Dynamic / Evolution Quality Attributes
Reflect the behaviour of a system durting its excution, e.g : throughput, robustness, scalability , etc ...

==== Common Quality Categories & Attributes
- Design Qualitites : Conceptual Integrity, Maintainability, Resuability .
- Runtime Qualities : Interoperbality, Manageability, Reliability, Scalability, Security, Performance, Availability.
- System Qualities : Suppotability, Testability.
- User Qualities : Usability .
- Architecture Qualities : Correctness .
- Non-Runtime Qualities : Portability, Integrality, Modifiability.
- Business Quality Attributes : Cost and Schedule, Marketability.
