= Blog + Wiki = Bliki

For now, this repo will serve as a temporary storage space for my draft documents until I decide which framework to publish on. 

== CMS to Consider

- https://antora.org[Antora] (Asciidoc based) 
- MediaWiki
- Dokuwiki (Flat File Wiki)
- OctoberCRM (with cutom asciidoc converter plugin) (Optional flat-file storage instead of DB)
