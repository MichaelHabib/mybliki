Source: https://askubuntu.com/a/588786
Arp-scan works great for me too...

If using Wi-Fi:

sudo arp-scan -l --interface=wlan0

-or if using ethernet:

sudo arp-scan -l --interface=eth0

(this last is practically identical to what Rajesh Rajendran posted; the -l standing for --localnet)

If you don't have arp-scan (it doesn't come with Ubuntu by default), just pull up a terminal and type:

sudo apt-get install arp-scan
